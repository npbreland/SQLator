# SQLator TODOs

## Sooner
* Publish composer package
* Create tests for non-read queries
* Create tests for more complex queries
* Make sure capitalization convention is consistent (SQLator vs Sqlator)
* Create README that outlines basic usage, suggested use cases, pitfalls,
testing, etc.
* Make compatible with other databases, not just MySQL. The major obstacle here
is that the command to show the table schema can differ among the other database
types. I could try to use the AI itself to give the correct syntax, or I could
try something like Doctrine.

## Later

## Maybe
* Allow other AIs besides OpenAI's
